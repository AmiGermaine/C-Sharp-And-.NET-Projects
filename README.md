# C-Sharp-And-.NET-Projects
 This repository contains some small basic C# projects that I learned at the Tech Academy.

 ## Projects
 * Twenty-One Game: This project taught me how to create a BlackJack game by using variest C# syntax. This project used multiple classes such as  base and inheriting classes, as well as an abstract class.
* CarInsurance: an MVC web application that takes in user information and gives a quote based on the information provided. It allows for user input to be tracked inside a database.
* Student Grade Code First: Code first approach in the entity framework. it shows how Entity Framework creates classes and inputs in data in the database.
